# Fizz Buzz
> fizzbuzz: (If you don't know what a FizzBuzz is, do a quick google, but in short, write a program that will automatically print numbers out "1, 2, etc." however any number that is a multiple of 3 print "fizz" any number that is a multiple of 5 print "buzz" any number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5 print "fizzbuzz")
