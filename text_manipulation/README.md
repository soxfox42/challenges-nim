# Text Manipulation

> text manipulation: Pig Latin. User inputs text, it gets converted in to pig latin. igpay atinlay isyay otnay ardhay otay ecodeday. ityay ecomesbay ardhay ifyay ethay irstfay etterlay isyay ayay owelvey. (Pig latin is not hard to decode. It becomes hard if the first letter is a vowel)

Correction: Pig Latin is *usually* not hard to decode. But it turns out there are more edge cases than just the first letter being a vowel, because all consonants before the first vowel are moved to the end (at least according to most explanations of Pig Latin online.) This might not seem important, but consider the following words:

smile -> ilesmay
miles -> ilesmay

Which word would we decode "ilesmay" to? In my list of 118082 English words, I found 652 such pairs, along with 6 triplets - my favourite is the angst-stang-tangs triplet.

Anyway, none of that is relevant, just an interesting diversion, since the challenge was just to convert text into Pig Latin, not the other way around.
